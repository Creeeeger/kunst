<h1>Disclaimer</h1>

	<h2></h2>

	<p>This disclaimer also covers features that are not yet available on this website but may be introduced in future versions. At the moment there are no links to external pages other than my own website: haerle-kunstvermittlung.com.<br>The only third parties involved as processors are the hosting provider UNITED DOMAINS, the web designer J&uuml;rgen Schr&ouml;ter with the SIQUANDO CMS, and my email software. This website does not use services such as Google Analytics or the Facebook Pixel.</p>
		<h2>Liability for the content of this website</h2>

	<p>The contents of these pages were created with great care. However, we cannot assume liability for the accuracy, completeness, or topicality of third-party content. As a service provider we are responsible for our own content on these pages in accordance with general legislation.<br>We are not obliged to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate unlawful activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information in accordance with general legislation remain unaffected.<br>Liability in this respect is only possible from the time we become aware of a specific infringement. If we become aware of any such legal violations, we will remove the content immediately.</p>
		<h2>Liability for links to third-party websites</h2>

	<p>Our offer does not currently include links to external websites, but we would like to point out the following as a precaution: we have no influence on the content of external websites. We therefore accept no liability for this third-party content. The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time the link was created; unlawful content was not recognisable at that time. However, permanent monitoring of the content of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of a legal violation.<br>If we become aware of any infringements, we will remove such links immediately.</p>
		<h2>Copyright</h2>
