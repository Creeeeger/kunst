						<strong>You are here:</strong> <a href="./index.html">Exhibitions (museums)</a><br>
	<p><br>As a networker with access to many private collections, I often discuss with collectors why certain works should not be made accessible to the public for a limited time. When this idea is followed through, both sides benefit: galleries and museums can enrich a special exhibition with a piece that would otherwise remain in private hands, and the owner can share the work with a wider audience while seeing it acknowledged anew in the art world.<br><br>Please feel free to contact me &ndash; whether you are responsible for a museum or are yourself a collector. Together we will find the right way to make it happen.</p>

<h1>Exhibitions (museums)</h1>

	<h2></h2>

	<p><br>As a networker with access to many private collections, the idea of why some works cannot be temporarilymadeaccessible to the public has been growing in my mind during confidential conversations with collectors of high-quality art. Taking this idea to its logical conclusion, this creates synergies for both sides: The gallery or museum gains access to a work that would otherwise be privately held as part of a temporary special exhibition. And the private owner gains the opportunity to share their work with the public, with the benefit of having this work recognized again in the art world.<br><br>Please feel free to contact me, whether as a museum director or collector; together we will find a way to make this happen.</p>
