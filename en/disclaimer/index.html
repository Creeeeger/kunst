<div class="sqrpara">
<p style="">This disclaimer also covers features that are not yet available on this website but may be introduced in future versions. At the moment, there are no links to external pages other than my own website: haerle-kunstvermittlung.com.<br/>The only third parties involved as processors are the hosting provider UNITED DOMAINS, the web designer Jürgen Schröter, and the email and form services I use. This website does not use services such as Google Analytics or the Facebook Pixel.</p>

<h2 id="133425aef10e3c913">Liability for links to third-party websites</h2>
<p style="">Our offer does not currently include links to external websites, but we would like to point out the following as a precaution: we have no influence on the content of external websites. We therefore accept no liability for this third-party content. The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time the link was created; unlawful content was not recognisable at that time. However, permanent monitoring of the content of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of a legal violation.<br/>If we become aware of any infringements, we will remove such links immediately.</p>
